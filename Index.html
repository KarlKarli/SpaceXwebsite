				<p> The Space Exploration Technologies Corporation is an American spacecraft manufacturer, launcher, and satellite communications corporation headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the stated goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. </p>

				<p style="font-size:20px; font-weight: bold;"> Short History Summary: </p>
				<p style="font-size:15px;"> In early 2001, Elon Musk donated US$100,000 to the Mars Society and joined its board of directors for a short time. He gave a plenary talk at their fourth convention where he announced Mars Oasis, a project to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars. Musk initially attempted to acquire a Dnepr ICBM for the project through Russian contacts. Two months later, however, the United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty and created the Missile Defense Agency, increasing tensions with Russia and generating new strategic interest for rapid and re-usable launch capability similar to the DC-X. </p>
				<p style="font-size:15px;"> (DC-X is a reusable single-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle that inspired Elon to pursue reusable space technology) </p>
				<p style="font-size:15px;"> On the flight home from Russie, Musk announced he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead. By applying vertical integration, using cheap commercial off-the-shelf components when possible, and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch price. <p>
				<p style="font-size:15px;"> Later on SpaceX would be approved for the $278 million award in 2006 before SpaceX had flown any rockets. In early 2002, Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket engineer Tom Mueller (later SpaceX's CTO of propulsion) and invited him to become his business partner. Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born.

		<h1 class="thickb"> Falcon 1 (The First)</h1>
		<p class="black3"> Falcon 1 was a small-lift launch vehicle that was operated from 2006 to 2009 by SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer. On 28 September 2008, Falcon 1 became the first privately-developed fully liquid-fueled launch vehicle to go into orbit around the Earth. The two-stage-to-orbit rocket used LOX/RP-1 for both stages, the first powered by a single Merlin engine and the second powered by a single Kestrel engine. It was designed by SpaceX from the ground up.
							The vehicle was launched a total of five times. After three failed launch attempts, Falcon 1 achieved orbit on its fourth attempt in September 2008 with a mass simulator as a payload. On 14 July 2009, Falcon 1 made its second successful flight, delivering the Malaysian RazakSAT satellite to orbit on SpaceX's first commercial launch (fifth and final launch overall).</p>

		<h1 class="thickb"> Falcon 9 (The Most Successful)</h1>
		<p class="black3">  Falcon 9 became the first rocket to land propulsively after delivering a payload into orbit. This reusability has resulted in significantly reduced launch costs. Falcon family core boosters have successfully landed 188 times in 199 attempts.</p>

		<h1 class="thickb"> SES O3B MPOWER MISSION (The Most Recent)</h1>
		<p class="black3">  On Friday, April 28 at 6:12 p.m. ET, SpaceX launched the SES O3b mPOWER mission to medium-Earth orbit from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This was the second launch and landing for this Falcon 9 first stage booster, which previously supported Crew-6.</p>
